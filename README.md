# Project Name
Welcome to the Project_Stack repository! This stack is designed as a modular, scalable foundation for developing a wide range of SaaS products using Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters) and Layered (Clean) Architecture principles. The stack is fully equipped to handle common SaaS requirements, including API integrations, data management, business logic, user authentication, and customizable frontends.

## Project Overview
This stack provides a foundational codebase for building and deploying SaaS applications. By applying modular, testable, and reusable design patterns, developers can quickly assemble different services, add new features, and scale their applications. Whether you’re building an e-commerce API, CRM system, data analysis tool, or chatbot service, this stack is designed to reduce boilerplate and standardize best practices.

## Architecture Overview
Our architecture combines Hexagonal (Ports and Adapters) Architecture with Layered (Clean) Architecture principles:

* Hexagonal Architecture: Centralizes core logic and enables modular "adapters" that handle inputs/outputs, making it simple to switch or update dependencies like databases, APIs, or message formats.
* Layered (Clean) Architecture: Separates the codebase into layers (Presentation, Application, Domain, and Infrastructure), creating clear separation of concerns and enabling each layer to be independently tested and maintained.  

This approach allows faster development cycles by making the code modular, testable, and easy to maintain.

## Getting Started
Prerequisites
* Python 3.12
* Flask for handling HTTP requests.
* PostgreSQL/MySQL (or any other compatible DB) for data persistence.
* Message Broker (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ) if the project requires asynchronous messaging.
* Any additional libraries required for specific SaaS features (e.g., payment gateways, analytics).

## Common Modules and Extensions
This stack includes pre-built components for rapid development. You can easily enable or extend these modules based on your SaaS product requirements:

## Best Practices
1. Maintain Separation of Concerns: Ensure each layer is focused on its responsibility. Keep business logic in core, I/O operations in interfaces, and request handling in controllers.
2. Testing:
    * Unit tests for each module and adapter (services and core logic).
    * Mock external services for isolated testing.
3. Error Handling: Centralize error handling in controllers and use custom exceptions for clarity.
4. Documentation: Document each module and function for easy readability.
5. Configuration: Keep sensitive data in environment variables, and define constants in app/stack/constant.
